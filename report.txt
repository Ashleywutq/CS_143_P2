#TASK 2

QUESTION 1: Take a look at labeled_data.csv. Write the functional dependencies implied by the data.
Input_id -> labeled, labelgop,labeldjt

QUESTION 2: Take a look at the schema for comments. Forget BCNF and 3NF. Does the data frame look normalized? In other words, is the data frame free of redundancies that might affect insert/update integrity? If not, how would we decompose it? Why do you believe the collector of the data stored it in this way?
it does not look like it's normalized since subreddit_id -> subreddit. To decompose it, we would remove the subreddit column from the comments table and create another table with subreddit_id and subreddit. It is easier for users to access the data.
